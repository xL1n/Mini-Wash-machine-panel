Power function: controls on/off states of wash machine


FUNCTION: There is a switch controls the on/off machine, if it's "on"(swicth is on), the green LED will be turned on and user can continue interact with machine, if is "off"(switch is off), red LED will be on, so that machine is off and user can not implement further functions(like cycle mode selection, parameter check).

IMPLEMENT: I used a "if" loop to implement this function, the green LED is connected to digital ("DigitalOut led_onpower(PC_1)",PC_1), red LED is connected to digital output ("DigitalOut led_offpower(PC_0);",PC_0), and power switch("DigitalIn powerswitch(PC_10);") is connected to PC_10

if the switch is connected to positive, (PC_10) reads 1, the green LED will on, which indicates user can interact with "machine", if the pin reads 0("else"), the red LED is on, indicating the "machine" is off, no interactions with machine 

Also, I have added pull down resistors for protecting the pins.
