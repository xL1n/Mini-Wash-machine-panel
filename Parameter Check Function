used to check the temperature of water during each stage of washing, also check the weight of cloths put in 

Function: this is to check the weight of laundry put into the machine, if machine cannot withstand the weight, it will alert and the machine will not work(not implement Washing function).

also, user can check the temperatures of water at 6 different sub stages of washing.

Implement : For the simulating displaying the water temperature at end of different stage, I firstly chose analogue  pin("AnalogIn TEM", PA_1) to get the value of temperature sensor(NTCLE100E3103) to convert the input value to "fake" degree just for simulation(for the function I just chose about 26degree as room temperature, add some calculations to make the value change rationally), after each sub-washing stages, I simulated different temperatures at different sub-washing stages by putting fingers on sensor, and use "printf" to display the value on screen. This whole function is implemented during "washing stage" 


For detecting force, i chose to analogue pin("AnalogIn FRC",PC_3) to get values on force sensor(MF01-N-221-A04)(simulated by put fingers on it), and i created a "weightcheck" function("int weightcheck()") which is used to check the value, if the value is larger than 85(force sensor detected >= "85%"), it will return 0, otherwise, it will return 1. this enables to implement "weight check function" as I created a if loop in the main function after the "cycle mode" has chosen but before washing stage, if the weightcheck function returns 0("weight" >=  85 %), it will print warning, and stop further "washing" stage. else(when return 1), it will continue to implement the "washing" stage.
