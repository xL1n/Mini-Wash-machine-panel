# Mini-Wash-machine-panel
I have used STM 32 Nucleo with breadboard and other electronic components(showed in "hardware_ued") to simluate a washing machine panel with some functions(power,washcycle selectioin, parameter check, washing), 
This is done during my first year of Bachelor of Electronic and Electrical Engineering .
(please see each branch for each function that this simulated panel is able to implement)
